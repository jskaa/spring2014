title: Including consoles in your posts
categories: how-to
---

You can include runnable code in your post by adding a Python console:

{% include python %}

for i in ["I", "love", "Python"]:
  print i
  
{% include endpython %}

You'll need some include statements to do this.  Include statements pull in code that starts and finishes the code block:

```
{% raw %}{% include python %}

for i in ["I", "love", "Python"]:
  print i
  
{% include endpython %}{% endraw %}
```

If you want more than one console in your post, add `id='uniqueID'` to the includes statement. Each console needs a unique id value:

```
{% raw %}{% include python id='1'%}

for i in ["I", "love", "Python", "too"]:
  print i
  
{% include endpython id='1' %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include python id='1'%}

for i in ["I", "love", "Python", "too"]:
  print i
  
{% include endpython id='1' %}

A HUGE thanks to SILShacker and TA Grant McLendon for getting this working and looking pretty.
