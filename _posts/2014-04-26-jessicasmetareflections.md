##Meetup Meta-reflection

For my meetups, I went to a 2 day hackathon hosted at UNC called PearlHacks, and also a local meetup hosted 
by Tripython known as Raleigh Project Night. Overall I really liked having the experience of going to 
these sort of coding meetups, since it gave me a chance to see what the community is like and also network. 
I'd been to a hackathon at Duke before, so it was nice seeing how it compared to PearlHacks. I think that 
between the types of meetups I've been to, I prefer the hackathons over the smaller meetups. Since I'm a beginner,
I think it's more helpful for me to attend hackathons where I can meet a lot of people and where I can attend
small workshops and learn things. Between the Duke Hackathon and PearlHacks, I've been able to learn a bit about
mobile development, javascript, ruby on rails, and microprocessors. Plus there are a lot of activities, tech talks, 
and plenty of people to meet and interact with. 

The smaller coding meetup I went to was not nearly as organized, and everyone just worked on their own things. 
As someone who doesn't have much experience, I just worked a little bit on Twython for a class assignment and 
didn't really know what else to do. It was not a very educational experience- I could have just gone to a coffee shop
locally and done work by myself, and the experience would probably be the same. I guess the experience
of smaller meetups also depends on who decides to go that week, and if they are social people as well. It is 
still nice knowing that if I do need help, I can go to these smaller meetups for assistance.

As of now I really prefer more structure in coding meetups. Since I'll be working in the triangle, I will definitely
attend more hackathons in the future, and will try to compete in them. I've learned a lot and enjoyed myself at
hackathons, and when I am more experienced and have my own projects, I'll likely attend more smaller meetups. 
It's great having such an available and supporting community though!
