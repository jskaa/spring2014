## Announcements

* I held office hours last week on Github posts with two attendees.  If you're still unclear on posts use your resources.  There is no more time built in for reviewing how to post on the class blog.  In fact we're going to learn how to do this from Nitrous soon, so it'll get get even more complex.
* Several open Github pull requests.
* Meetups- Anyone attended one?

## Nitrous

Just a trial run here:

* In the console:
  * Type `pwd` to see where you are.  Should be `/home/action`
  * Type `cd spring2014` to **c**hange **d**irectories into the project
  * Type `gem install github-pages` to install the tools that Github uses to make our github.io pages (Most notably, Jekyll)
  * Type `jekyll serve --watch` to start up jekyll and tell it to watch what you do.  Note the `--watch` has two hyphens.
  * From the Preview menu, select 4000.  This new page/tab will 404.  That's ok.
  * Add `/spring2014` onto the end of the URL (mine is http://trinket-68987.use1.nitrousbox.com:4000/spring2014/).  You should see a copy of our class site!

* Create a new post titled "Nitrous test post" with today's date
* Click the + icon in the console to open a new window.
* Make sure you've [set up git]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to/2014/02/01/git-howto.html}}).  The email **must** match waht you've used for Github for your work to show up properly.
* In the console, 
    * type `git status` to see what's going on.
    * type `git add .`.  Note the period.
    * type `git status` to see what's going on.
    * type `git commit -m "Commit message"`, replacing 'Commit message' with a real description of your changes.
 
 That's it!  You've made your first commit from the command line.  If you revist the Preview page you should see your new post there.  Nice!
